                <h3>Frustrations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Lack of central workspace “usually write invoices at the end of the day on my laptop using a Word template I made years ago. I save it as a PDF and email it to clients. For tracking, I keep a notebook behind the counter where I mark who’s paid and who hasn’t. Sometimes I also check my bank app to see if money came in.”]</li>
                    <li>[Hard to keep up with everything “it’s repetitive but manageable. The hardest part is tracking. When it gets busy, I forget to update my notebook, and then later I don’t remember if someone paid or not.”]</li>
                    <li>[Lack of bookkeeping “Last month a regular client insisted she already paid. I couldn’t find the record, and I felt awkward pushing back. Turns out she paid cash to one of my staff and it never got written down.”]</li>
